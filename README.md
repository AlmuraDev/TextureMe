About

TextureMe is a plugin that allows you to change your texture pack in game, which is also downloaded for later use on any server. You can have unlimited texture packs to be chosen and decide whether or not the user should be prompted when they join. You can also open the menu by pressing the key binding ('P' by default) but can be changed in the Spoutcraft controls menu under "plugin key bindings". As of v0.3 you can now have the plugin remember a players selection. This is great for combatting x-ray plugins because you can force them to use either a default pack or a given one.

TextureMe is [open source][GitHub]
